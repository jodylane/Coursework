            <p>There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. Allons-y! Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! New-new-Doctor. Yeah? Well I'm the Lord of Time. Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso!</p>
        
			<p>There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! New-new-Doctor. You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. Don't you think she looks tired? River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could... I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. Allons-y! You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'.</p>
