            <p>There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! I don't want to go. I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff.</p>
        
			<p>River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could... Allons-y! I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords.</p>
