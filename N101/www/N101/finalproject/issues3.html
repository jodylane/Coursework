    	<p>Making my portfolio website was probably the funnest and hardest thing that I have done all year. While I was coding the layout of my portfolio I had many issues. I had my background image that was not being set as a background. It was being set as an image and it burried every thing I was making underneath the image. So to fix this problem I tried googling w3schools for similar problems and sure enough I found a solution on how to fix it. So to fix the problem was instead of placing the image directly in my source code I put in my css style sheet under body and gave it a background-image:url("images/BGCred.jpg"); style tag. That fixed the issue until I started making my sketches, issues, final design pages. because I had so many anchor tags and designs going on I had initially wanted to put the skethces issues and final design all on one page but my background would repeat images because it was so long and it also was burrying my content again so I decided to split it all on different pages and I also had to use line breaks because margin wasnt working for my anchor tags below this paragraph. But I think in the end I got a nice overall portfolio finished.</p>
