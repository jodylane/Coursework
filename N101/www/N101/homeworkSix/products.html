				<p>Don't you think she looks tired? There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! I'm the 		Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. Black tie...Whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. .</p>

				<p>River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could... What? What?! WHAT?! Please, when Torchwood comes to write my complete history, don't tell people I travelled through time and space with her mother! Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. .</p>

				<p>You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'. What? What?! WHAT?! Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. </p>
