				<p> Don't you think she looks tired? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could... New-new-Doctor. I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger.</p>
				<p>You are the only mystery worth solving. Usually called 'The Doctor.' Or 'The Caretaker.' Or 'Get off this planet.' Though, strictly speaking, that probably isn't a name. Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.
